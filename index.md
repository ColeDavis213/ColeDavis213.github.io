## Cole Davis's Portfolio (WIP)

### About Me

I am a recent graduate from the University of Tennessee at Martin with a BA in Computer Science. I am currently interested in going into the software development field and I am excitingly learning new things to better prepare me for it, in school and out. I also have over a year of customer service experience through my time at a local Pizza Hut, and I am currently getting more specific job-related experience as an IT intern at the Discovery Park of America in Union City, TN.

### Jekyll Themes

Your Pages site will use the layout and styles from the Jekyll theme you have selected in your [repository settings](https://github.com/ColeDavis213/ColeDavis213.github.io/settings). The name of this theme is saved in the Jekyll `_config.yml` configuration file.
